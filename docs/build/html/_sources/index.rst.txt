Stability-based relative clustering validation to determine the best number of cluster
======================================================================================

``reval`` allows to determine the best number of clusters to partition datasets without a priori knowledge.
It leverages a stability-based relative clustering validation method (Lange et al., 2004) that transforms
a clustering algorithm into a supervised classification problem and selects the number of clusters
that lead to the minimum expected misclassification error, i.e., stability.

This library allows to:
1. Select any classification algorithm from ``sklearn`` library;
2. Select a clustering algorithm with ``n_clusters`` parameter, i.e., choose among ``sklearn.cluster.KMeans``,
``sklearn.cluster.AgglomerativeClustering``, ``sklearn.cluster.SpectralClustering``;
3. Perform *k*-fold cross-validation to determine the best number of clusters;
4. Test the final model on an held-out dataset.

Underlying mathematics can be found in (Lange et al., 2004), whereas code can be found on `github
<https://github.com/IIT-LAND/relative_validation_clustering>`__.

The analysis steps performed by ``reval`` package are displayed below.
